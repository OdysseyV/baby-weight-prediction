# Baby Weight Prediction using Linear Regression

This project builds a linear regression model to predict infant birth weight based on clinical and demographic data. It was developed as part of a machine learning coursework assignment.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict the target variable `BWEIGHT` using structured input features
- **Tools Used:** Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Dataset:** Provided `.csv` files containing birth weight data and a test set without labels

## 📊 Features

- Data preprocessing using `pandas`
- Feature/target separation and train/test split
- Model training with `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`
- Evaluation using RMSE and MAE
- Visualization of feature relationships and model performance

## 📁 Files

- `Assignment-2-notebook.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete code and output
- `judge-without-labels.csv` – Unlabeled test data for prediction
- `submission.csv` – Final predictions file

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Regression modeling
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE)
- Data visualization
- Machine learning workflows in healthcare-relevant data
